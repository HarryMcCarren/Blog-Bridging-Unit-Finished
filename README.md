# Blog-Bridging-Unit-Finished
Finished Bridging Unit.
Please note to the marker. If you encounter difficulties with displaying static content such as static content not displaying or python manage.py collectstatic failing,
Please make a directory called "media" at the root of this project. When calling, collectstatic Django expects a folder called media to be present which contains media
assets. However, since Git does not allow empty files to be uploaded, this was not possible to include.
Sorry for any inconvenience caused.
